# Tasks: Internal Developer Portal (IDP)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-internal-developer-portal/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✅), research.md (✅), data-model.md (✅), contracts/ (✅)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Tech stack: Go 1.21+, NextJS 14 with PayloadCMS, PostgreSQL, Redis, Temporal
   → Structure: Microservices (repository, api-catalog, knowledge services) + Temporal workflows
2. Load design documents: ✅
   → data-model.md: 5 core entities (Workspace, Repository, APISchema, KnowledgeSpace, User)
   → contracts/: 7 protobuf files (workspace, repository, api_catalog, knowledge, auth, common, pagination)
   → quickstart.md: 5 integration scenarios
3. Generate tasks by category: Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
4. Apply task rules: TDD mandatory, different files = [P], tests before implementation
5. Validate completeness: All contracts tested, all entities modeled
```

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Verify completeness before execution*

- [✅] All 7 protobuf contracts have corresponding test tasks (T011-T018)
- [✅] All 5 core entities have model creation tasks (T029-T034)
- [✅] All 5 quickstart scenarios have integration tests (T019-T023)
- [✅] All tests come before implementation (T011-T028 before T029+)
- [✅] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files/services)
- [✅] Each task specifies exact file path
- [✅] Constitutional requirements embedded (TDD, performance, security, quality gates)
- [✅] Multi-service architecture properly handled (3 Go services + frontend + CMS)

## TDD Progress Status
**Contract Tests**: T015-T018 ✅ COMPLETED (API Catalog & Knowledge services)
**Integration Tests**: T019-T023 ✅ COMPLETED (All user scenarios)
**Remaining Contract Tests**: T011-T014 (Repository service) - Ready for next phase
**Constitutional Gate**: ✅ TDD pattern established, all completed tests demonstrate proper failures

## Notes
- **CONSTITUTIONAL**: Tests must fail before implementing (TDD mandatory)
- **CONSTITUTIONAL**: 90% business logic coverage, 80% overall coverage required
- **CONSTITUTIONAL**: <200ms p95 API responses, <100ms auth, <30s code generation
- **CONSTITUTIONAL**: Security scanning must pass without high-severity vulnerabilities
- **Multi-tenant**: All database queries must include workspace context for isolation
- **Performance**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data, proper PostgreSQL indexing
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 + JWT tokens, RBAC with workspace-level permissions, audit logging
- Commit after each task completion with descriptive messages
- Services communicate via gRPC with protobuf definitions
- Frontend uses NextJS App Router with server-side rendering where beneficial

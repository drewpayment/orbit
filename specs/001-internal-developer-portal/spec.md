# Feature Specification: Internal Developer Portal (IDP)

**Feature Branch**: `001-internal-developer-portal`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Internal Developer Portal (IDP) - Technical Documentation Suite"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A development team lead wants to create a new microservice repository using established company patterns, generate API client libraries from their service definitions, and maintain technical documentation in a centralized platform accessible to all team members.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a team lead needs to create a new service, **When** they access the repository creation interface, **Then** they can select from pre-approved templates and automatically generate a new repository with proper configuration
2. **Given** a developer has defined their API using protocol buffers, **When** they upload the schema to the platform, **Then** client libraries are automatically generated for all supported languages
3. **Given** a team needs to document their service architecture, **When** they create content in their team space, **Then** other teams can search and discover this knowledge across the organization
4. **Given** multiple teams are working on interconnected services, **When** they view the API catalog, **Then** they can see service dependencies and compatibility information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a repository template is invalid or incomplete?
- How does the system handle conflicting API schema versions?
- What occurs when team documentation contains sensitive information that should be restricted?
- How does the system respond when code generation fails for a specific language?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enable users to create new repositories from predefined templates
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate repository configurations against organizational policies  
- **FR-003**: System MUST support multi-tenant workspaces with proper data isolation

- **PR-002**: Code generation MUST complete within 30 seconds for large schemas
- **PR-003**: Repository synchronization MUST complete within 2 minutes for 10,000 files
- **PR-004**: System MUST support 500 concurrent users per workspace
- **PR-005**: Full-text search results MUST return within 1 second for typical queries

### Security Requirements  
- **SR-001**: All data transmission MUST use TLS 1.3 encryption
- **SR-002**: Sensitive data MUST be encrypted at rest using AES-256

# Research: Internal Developer Portal (IDP)

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework Selection

**Decision**: Payload 3.0 with integrated NextJS 15  
**Rationale**: 
- Modern headless CMS with built-in admin interface and user management
- Native TypeScript support with auto-generated types
- Built-in authentication and role-based access control
- Integrated NextJS 15 for optimal performance and developer experience
- Local development with SQLite, production with PostgreSQL
- Extensible collections system perfect for multi-tenant architecture

**Alternatives Considered**: 
- NextJS + separate PayloadCMS: More complex setup, additional service overhead
- Remix: Good for full-stack apps but smaller ecosystem
- SvelteKit: Excellent performance but less enterprise adoption

### Content Management System

**Decision**: Payload 3.0 as integrated application  
**Rationale**:
- TypeScript-native with auto-generated types for all collections
- Built-in authentication, user management, and file uploads
- Integrated directly with NextJS 15 for optimal performance
- Flexible schema definition matching our entity requirements
- Built-in role-based access control and multi-tenancy support
- Local development with SQLite, production scaling with PostgreSQL
- Modern admin UI with extensible components

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate PayloadCMS service: More operational overhead and complexity
- Strapi: Good but less TypeScript integration, requires separate service
- Directus: SQL-based but more complex setup
- Contentful: SaaS-only, less control over data and functionality

### Backend Services Language

**Decision**: Go 1.21+ for core services  
**Rationale**:
- Excellent Kubernetes ecosystem integration
- Strong concurrency model for handling multiple repositories
- Fast compilation and deployment
- Excellent protobuf support via protoc-gen-go
- Strong static typing and error handling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Rust: Excellent performance but steeper learning curve
- Java: Good enterprise support but higher memory usage
- Python: Good for rapid development but performance concerns

### Database Selection

**Decision**: PostgreSQL 15+  
**Rationale**:
- JSON support for flexible schema evolution
- Full-text search capabilities for documentation
- ACID compliance for multi-tenant data integrity
- Excellent performance with proper indexing
- Wide ecosystem support and tooling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- MySQL: Good performance but less JSON support
- CockroachDB: Great for distributed systems but complexity overhead

### Workflow Orchestration

**Decision**: Temporal for long-running workflows  
**Rationale**:
- Durable execution for complex multi-step processes
- Built-in retry and error handling mechanisms
- Excellent observability and debugging capabilities
- Strong consistency guarantees for workflow state
- Supports long-running operations like code generation
- Good integration with Go services
- Provides workflow history and audit trails

**Alternatives Considered**:
- NATS with JetStream: Good for simple messaging but lacks workflow orchestration
- Apache Kafka: More complex setup, primarily for event streaming
- AWS Step Functions: Vendor lock-in, not suitable for self-hosted

### Inter-Service Communication

**Decision**: Direct gRPC calls with Temporal for workflows  
**Rationale**:
- Direct gRPC for synchronous operations (low latency)
- Temporal workflows for asynchronous, long-running processes
- Type-safe communication via protobuf definitions
- Better error handling and timeout control
- Simpler operational model than message queues

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure message bus (NATS/Kafka): Good for decoupling but adds complexity
- REST APIs: Less efficient for internal communication
- GraphQL federation: More complex setup for internal services

### Search Engine

**Decision**: MeiliSearch  
**Rationale**:
- Simple deployment and configuration
- Fast indexing and search performance
- Excellent relevance scoring out of the box
- Low resource requirements
- Good API design

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Elasticsearch: More features but complex setup
- Typesense: Good alternative but smaller community

### Code Generation Framework

**Decision**: Buf CLI with protoc-gen-go  
**Rationale**:
- Modern protobuf toolchain with breaking change detection
- Excellent multi-language support
- Good integration with Git workflows
- Schema registry capabilities
- Active development and community

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Raw protoc: Less features and harder to manage
- Twirp: Good but more opinionated architecture

## Architecture Patterns

### Multi-Tenancy Strategy

**Decision**: Shared database with workspace isolation  
**Rationale**:
- Simpler operational model for demo phase
- Row-level security for data isolation
- Cost-effective for smaller tenant counts
- Can migrate to database-per-tenant later if needed

### Authentication Strategy  

**Decision**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens  
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for developer tools
- Good integration with GitHub, Google, Azure AD
- Stateless tokens reduce database load
- Refresh token mechanism for security

### API Design Pattern

**Decision**: REST APIs with OpenAPI specification  
**Rationale**:
- Widely understood by developers
- Good tooling for documentation and client generation
- Simple HTTP semantics
- Easy to cache and optimize

### Event-Driven Architecture

**Decision**: Temporal workflows for orchestration  
**Rationale**:
- Durable execution ensures completion of long-running processes
- Built-in saga pattern support for distributed transactions
- Workflow versioning for backward compatibility
- Rich observability and debugging capabilities
- Event sourcing through workflow history

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-layer caching with Redis  
**Rationale**:
- API response caching for frequently accessed data
- Session storage for user authentication
- Generated code artifact caching
- Search index caching for better performance

### Database Optimization

**Decision**: Read replicas and connection pooling  
**Rationale**:
- Distribute read load across replicas
- Connection pooling reduces database overhead
- Proper indexing strategy for query performance
- Pagination for large result sets

### Code Generation Optimization

**Decision**: Background job processing with Temporal  
**Rationale**:
- Offload long-running operations from API responses
- Retry mechanism for failed generations
- Progress tracking for user feedback
- Workflow orchestration for complex operations

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

**Decision**: Encryption at rest and in transit  
**Rationale**:
- TLS 1.3 for all HTTP communications
- Database encryption for sensitive data
- Encrypted secrets management
- Regular security audits

### Access Control

**Decision**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
**Rationale**:
- Workspace-level isolation
- Fine-grained permissions per resource
- Integration with external identity providers
- Audit logging for compliance

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-level testing pyramid  
**Rationale**:
- Unit tests for business logic (90% coverage target)
- Integration tests for API contracts
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance tests for scalability validation

### Deployment Strategy

**Decision**: Container-based with Docker Compose for demo  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent deployment across environments
- Easy local development setup
- Migration path to Kubernetes for production
- Infrastructure as Code with proper versioning

# Knowledge Management Frontend Routes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created complete frontend experience for the Knowledge Management Navigator feature with three main routes and dynamic sidebar navigation.

## Routes Created

### 1. Knowledge Base List (`/workspaces/[slug]/knowledge/page.tsx`)
**Purpose:** Display all knowledge spaces for a workspace

**Features:**
- Grid layout showing all knowledge spaces
- Each card displays:
  - Space name with optional icon
  - Description (truncated to 2 lines)
  - Visibility badge (public/internal/private) with color coding
  - Page statistics (total pages, published count)
- Empty state when no spaces exist
- Hover effects and transition to space detail
- Full workspace context (header, sidebar)

**Data Fetched:**
- Workspace by slug
- All knowledge spaces for workspace
- Page counts and statistics for each space

### 2. Space Detail (`/workspaces/[slug]/knowledge/[spaceSlug]/page.tsx`)
**Purpose:** Display a specific knowledge space with page navigation

**Features:**
- **Left Sidebar:**
  - SpaceNavigator component with hierarchical page tree
  - Collapsible parent pages with folder icons
  - Draft indicators
  - Statistics card (total pages, published, drafts)
  
- **Main Content:**
  - Space header with icon and description
  - Welcome message
  - Recent pages list (first 5) with links
  - Draft badges on unpublished pages

**Data Fetched:**
- Workspace and space by slugs
- All pages in the space (for navigation tree)
- Page statistics

### 3. Page View (`/workspaces/[slug]/knowledge/[spaceSlug]/[pageSlug]/page.tsx`)
**Purpose:** Display individual knowledge page with full content

**Features:**
- **Breadcrumb Navigation:**
  - Knowledge Base → Space Name → Page Title
  
- **Left Sidebar:**
  - SpaceNavigator with current page highlighted
  - Auto-expand to show current page location
  
- **Page Content:**
  - Status badges (Draft/Archived)
  - Page title
  - Metadata: author, last updated, last edited by
  - Full Lexical content rendered with prose styling
  - Tags display
  - Child pages (sub-pages) list with links

**Data Fetched:**
- Workspace, space, and page by slugs
- All pages in space (for navigation)
- Full page content with relationships (author, lastEditedBy, childPages)
- Depth 2 to get related data

## Component Updates

### SpaceNavigator Component
**Updated:** Added `workspaceSlug` prop (optional)
- Allows navigation to use proper frontend routes
- Maintains backward compatibility for admin usage
- Passes workspace and space slugs to PageTreeNode

### PageTreeNode Component
**Updated:** Added `workspaceSlug` and `spaceSlug` props (optional)
- Builds proper URLs for frontend navigation
- Falls back to hash anchors when slugs not provided
- Recursive passing of props to child nodes
- Maintains admin compatibility

### AppSidebar Component
**Updated:** Dynamic Documentation link
- Detects current workspace from URL pathname
- Updates Documentation link to point to workspace knowledge base
- When in `/workspaces/engineering`, Documentation links to `/workspaces/engineering/knowledge`
- Falls back to `#` when not in workspace context
- Uses React.useMemo for performance

## Navigation Flow

```
1. User navigates to workspace: /workspaces/engineering
   └─> Sidebar "Documentation" link updates to: /workspaces/engineering/knowledge

2. Click "Documentation" → Knowledge Base List
   └─> Shows all knowledge spaces in grid

3. Click a knowledge space card → Space Detail
   └─> Shows page navigation tree + welcome content

4. Click a page in tree → Page View
   └─> Shows full page content with Lexical rendering
   └─> Navigation tree highlights current page
   └─> Can navigate to sibling/child pages
```

## Styling & UI

**Design System:**
- Uses shadcn/ui components throughout
- Consistent card-based layouts
- Proper dark mode support
- Responsive grid layouts (1 col → 2 cols → 3 cols)
- Sidebar layouts with 300px navigation column

**Visual Elements:**
- Icons for visibility (Globe, Users, Lock)
- Color-coded badges (green=published, yellow=draft, gray=archived)
- Folder icons for parent pages
- File icons for regular pages
- Hover effects and transitions
- Breadcrumb navigation

## Data Loading

All routes are **Server Components** for optimal performance:
- Data fetched on server
- No client-side hydration delay
- SEO friendly
- Fast initial load

**Payload API Usage:**
- `payload.find()` for collections with filters
- `where` clauses for relationships
- `depth: 2` for nested relationships on page view
- `sort` and `limit` parameters for ordering

## Integration Points

1. **With Payload Admin:**
   - Can create/edit spaces and pages in admin
   - Changes immediately visible on frontend
   - No caching layer (always fresh data)

2. **With Workspace System:**
   - Fully integrated with workspace context
   - Respects workspace hierarchy
   - Uses workspace slugs for clean URLs

3. **With Lexical Editor:**
   - Uses serializeLexical utility
   - Renders rich text content
   - Prose styling with dark mode support

## URLs Structure

```
/workspaces/engineering/knowledge
  └─> Knowledge base list

/workspaces/engineering/knowledge/api-docs
  └─> Space detail (api-docs space)

/workspaces/engineering/knowledge/api-docs/getting-started
  └─> Page view (getting-started page in api-docs space)
```

## Access Control

Currently uses server-side data fetching with Payload's built-in access control:
- Collections have workspace-based access rules
- Only workspace members can see private/internal spaces
- Public spaces visible to all authenticated users
- Draft pages visible but marked with badge

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not implemented):
- Search functionality across pages
- Version history display
- Page edit links for authorized users
- Commenting system
- Page templates
- Export to PDF
- Print styling
- Table of contents for long pages
- Related pages suggestions
- Analytics (page views, popular pages)

## Testing

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
1. ✅ Navigate to workspace
2. ✅ Click Documentation in sidebar
3. ✅ See knowledge spaces grid
4. ✅ Click a space card
5. ✅ See page navigation tree
6. ✅ Click a page in tree
7. ✅ See full page content
8. ✅ Navigate between pages
9. ✅ Breadcrumb navigation works
10. ✅ Back to knowledge base link works

**What Still Needs Testing:**
- Unit tests for tree builder
- Integration tests for collections
- End-to-end user flows
- Performance with large page counts
- Mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

## Files Created

1. `/src/app/(frontend)/workspaces/[slug]/knowledge/page.tsx` (226 lines)
2. `/src/app/(frontend)/workspaces/[slug]/knowledge/[spaceSlug]/page.tsx` (208 lines)
3. `/src/app/(frontend)/workspaces/[slug]/knowledge/[spaceSlug]/[pageSlug]/page.tsx` (267 lines)

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Added dynamic Documentation link
2. `/src/components/features/knowledge/SpaceNavigator.tsx` - Added workspaceSlug prop
3. `/src/components/features/knowledge/PageTreeNode.tsx` - Added proper URL building
4. `/src/components/features/knowledge/types.ts` - Updated interfaces

## Total Implementation

- **3 new route pages**
- **4 component updates**
- **~700 lines of new code**
- **Full frontend knowledge management system**
- **Integrated with existing workspace navigation**

## Result

Users can now:
✅ Browse knowledge spaces from any workspace
✅ Navigate hierarchical page structures
✅ Read full page content with rich formatting
✅ See page metadata and relationships
✅ Have context-aware sidebar navigation
✅ Experience consistent UI across admin and frontend

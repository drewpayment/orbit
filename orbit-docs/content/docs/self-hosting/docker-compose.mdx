# Docker Compose Deployment

Docker Compose is the simplest way to get Orbit running. It's ideal for:

- Local development
- Evaluation and demos
- Small team deployments (< 50 users)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:drewpayment/orbit.git
cd orbit

# Copy environment config
cp orbit-www/.env.example orbit-www/.env
# Edit orbit-www/.env with your settings (see Configuration)

# Start everything
make dev
```

## What Gets Started

The Docker Compose setup launches:

| Service | Image | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `orbit-www` | Built from source | Frontend + CMS |
| `mongodb` | `mongo:7` | Application database |
| `postgres` | `postgres:15` | Temporal persistence |
| `redis` | `redis:7` | Caching & sessions |
| `temporal` | `temporalio/auto-setup` | Workflow engine |
| `temporal-ui` | `temporalio/ui` | Workflow monitoring |
| `temporal-worker` | Built from source | Workflow execution |
| `meilisearch` | `getmeili/meilisearch` | Full-text search |
| `minio` | `minio/minio` | Object storage |
| `redpanda` | `redpandadata/redpanda` | Kafka-compatible broker |
| `redpanda-console` | `redpandadata/console` | Kafka topic UI |

## Documentation Site (Optional)

Orbit ships with a separate documentation site (`orbit-docs`) built with Fumadocs. It's completely optional — if you don't need hosted docs, simply skip this section.

### Enabling the Docs Service

The docs service uses a Docker Compose **profile**, so it doesn't start by default:

```bash
# Start everything including the docs site
docker compose --profile docs up -d

# Or start just the docs service alongside the rest
docker compose --profile docs up -d orbit-docs
```

### Connecting Docs to the UI

To show "Docs" links in the Orbit marketing page header and the app sidebar, set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL` environment variable in `orbit-www/.env`:

```bash
# Point to wherever your docs site is hosted
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

When this variable is **set**, Orbit shows:
- A **"Docs"** link in the marketing page header (left of "Log In")
- A **"Documentation"** link in the app sidebar (bottom, next to Feedback)

When this variable is **unset or empty**, both links are hidden — no dead links in your UI.

### Reverse Proxy Setup

If you want docs served under the same domain (e.g., `orbit.example.com/docs`), configure your reverse proxy to route `/docs` traffic to the docs service. With Caddy:

```
orbit.example.com {
    handle /docs* {
        reverse_proxy localhost:3001
    }
    handle {
        reverse_proxy localhost:3000
    }
}
```

Then set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL=/docs` (relative path works too).

Alternatively, host docs on a subdomain (`docs.orbit.example.com`) and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL=https://docs.orbit.example.com`.

## Production Considerations

Docker Compose works for small deployments, but for production you should:

- Use **external managed databases** (MongoDB Atlas, Amazon RDS) instead of containerized DBs
- Set up **backup and restore** procedures
- Configure **TLS termination** via a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik)
- Set up **monitoring** (Prometheus + Grafana or similar)
- Consider [Kubernetes](/docs/self-hosting/kubernetes) for larger deployments

## Reverse Proxy Example

Here's a minimal Caddy config to put Orbit behind TLS:

```
orbit.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}

temporal.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

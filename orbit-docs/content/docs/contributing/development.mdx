# Development Setup

This guide walks through setting up Orbit for local development.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.20.2+ or 20.9.0+
- **Bun** (latest)
- **Go** 1.21+
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose** v2+
- **Make**

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:drewpayment/orbit.git
cd orbit

# Start infrastructure services
make dev-local

# In another terminal — start the frontend
cd orbit-www
bun install
bun run dev
```

The frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000` with hot module reloading.

## Working on Go Services

Each Go service has its own `go.mod`. To work on a service:

```bash
cd services/repository
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

Or use the Makefile targets:

```bash
make run-repository-service
make run-api-catalog-service
make run-knowledge-service
```

## Working on Protocol Buffers

When modifying `.proto` files in `proto/`:

```bash
# Regenerate both Go and TypeScript code
make proto-gen
```

Generated Go code lands in `proto/gen/go/`, TypeScript clients in `orbit-www/src/lib/proto/`.

## Working on Temporal Workflows

```bash
cd temporal-workflows
go run cmd/worker/main.go
```

The worker connects to the Temporal server started by `make dev-local` and begins processing workflow tasks.

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
make test

# Frontend only
cd orbit-www && bun test

# Go services
cd services/repository && go test ./...

# Temporal workflows
cd temporal-workflows && go test ./...
```

## Linting

```bash
make lint
```

This runs ESLint on the frontend and `golangci-lint` on Go code.

## Database Seeds

The frontend uses Payload CMS migrations. On first run, Payload auto-creates collections in MongoDB. For Temporal, the `temporalio/auto-setup` Docker image handles schema creation automatically.

## Common Issues

### Port conflicts
If port 3000 is in use, either stop the conflicting process or set `PORT=3001` for the frontend.

### MongoDB connection errors
Ensure Docker containers are running: `docker ps | grep mongo`

### Temporal connection timeout
The Temporal server takes 15-30 seconds to initialize. Wait for it to be healthy before starting the worker.

# Orbit

**Orbit** is an open-source Internal Developer Portal (IDP) that gives platform teams self-service infrastructure while maintaining governance. It's the single pane of glass for services, APIs, Kafka topics, and documentation across your organization.

## The Problem

Platform teams face a common challenge: developers need fast, autonomous access to infrastructure — repositories, deployments, Kafka topics, documentation — but without guardrails this leads to sprawl, inconsistency, and lost context.

Orbit bridges this gap by providing:

- **Self-service with guardrails** — Teams provision resources autonomously within policy boundaries
- **Lineage tracking** — Every deployed application traces back to its origin template
- **Unified catalog** — Single pane of glass for services, APIs, topics, and docs
- **GitOps-ready** — Designed for `.orbit.yaml` manifest sync between UI and repositories

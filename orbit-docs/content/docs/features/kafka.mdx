# Kafka Self-Service (Project Bifrost)

Orbit provides self-service Kafka access through **Project Bifrost** — a multi-tenant gateway that gives teams autonomous topic creation, schema management, and consumer group tracking while platform admins maintain governance.

## How It Works

Bifrost acts as a proxy layer between applications and your Kafka cluster(s):

1. **Platform admins** register Kafka clusters and configure environment mappings
2. **Teams** request virtual clusters for their applications within a workspace
3. **Bifrost** handles multi-tenant routing, authentication, and policy enforcement
4. **Teams** self-service create topics, manage schemas, and monitor consumer groups

## Key Capabilities

### Virtual Clusters
Each application/environment gets its own virtual cluster with isolated topics and consumer groups. Virtual clusters are provisioned automatically via Temporal workflows.

### Topic Management
- Create, configure, and delete topics within your virtual cluster
- Set partition counts, replication factors, and retention policies
- View topic metadata and configuration

### Schema Registry
- Register and manage Avro, Protobuf, and JSON schemas
- Schema compatibility enforcement (backward, forward, full)
- Auto-discovery of schemas from repository code

### Consumer Groups
- Monitor consumer group lag and offsets
- Track active consumers across environments

### Governance
- Approval workflows for virtual cluster provisioning
- Quota enforcement per workspace/team
- Chargeback rate configuration for cost attribution

## Kafka Provider Setup

Orbit supports any Kafka-compatible broker. To configure:

1. **Create a Kafka Provider** (Admin Panel → Kafka Providers):
   - Name your provider (e.g., `redpanda`, `confluent`)
   - Set the adapter type (`apache` for standard Kafka protocol)
   - Define required configuration fields

2. **Register a Cluster** (Admin Panel → Kafka Clusters):
   - Associate with a provider
   - Provide connection config (`bootstrap.servers`, credentials)

3. **Map Environments** (Admin Panel → Kafka Environment Mappings):
   - Map environments (development, staging, production) to clusters
   - Set priorities for failover

## Bifrost Gateway

The Bifrost gateway is a Go service that handles:

- **Proxy routing** — Routes Kafka protocol traffic to the correct cluster
- **Authentication** — Validates workspace membership and permissions
- **Metrics** — Exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- **Admin gRPC** — Management API for provisioning operations

Bifrost runs as a separate container alongside your Kafka infrastructure.

# Knowledge Management

Orbit's knowledge management system provides collaborative documentation that lives alongside your services, APIs, and infrastructure.

![Knowledge Base](/screenshots/knowledge.png)

## How It Works

Documentation is organized into **Knowledge Bases**, each containing **Pages** organized in a hierarchical structure:

- **Knowledge Bases** are scoped to workspaces
- **Pages** support rich-text editing with Markdown and embedded media
- **Full-text search** via MeiliSearch for instant document discovery

## Creating a Knowledge Base

1. Navigate to **Documentation** from the sidebar
2. Click **Create Knowledge Base**
3. Choose a name and visibility (public or private to workspace)

## Page Editor

The built-in editor supports:

- Rich text formatting (headings, bold, italic, lists, tables)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Image and file attachments (stored in MinIO/S3)
- Internal links to other pages, applications, or APIs
- Version history with rollback

## Visibility Controls

- **Public** — Accessible to all authenticated users
- **Workspace-only** — Restricted to workspace members
- **Draft** — Only visible to the author until published

## Search

MeiliSearch powers the documentation search engine:

- **Instant results** as you type
- **Typo tolerance** for fuzzy matching
- **Faceted search** by workspace, knowledge base, and tags
- Results include highlighted snippets showing matching content

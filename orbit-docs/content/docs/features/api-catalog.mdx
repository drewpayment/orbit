# API Catalog

The API Catalog provides a central registry for all your organization's APIs — enabling discovery, documentation, and governance across teams.

## Supported Schema Types

- **OpenAPI** (v3.x) — REST APIs
- **AsyncAPI** — Event-driven APIs (Kafka, WebSocket, MQTT)

## Features

### Schema Registration
Register API schemas manually or let Orbit auto-discover them from your repositories. Schemas are versioned and tracked over time.

### Discovery & Search
Developers can browse and search the full API catalog to find existing APIs before building new ones — reducing duplication and promoting reuse.

### Auto-Discovery
When a GitHub App is configured, Orbit can scan repositories for:
- `openapi.yaml` / `openapi.json` files
- `asyncapi.yaml` / `asyncapi.json` files
- Protobuf `.proto` files

Discovered schemas are automatically registered and linked to their source application.

### Schema Viewer
View rendered API documentation directly in Orbit with:
- Endpoint listings with request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Example payloads

### Governance
- Track which teams own which APIs
- Monitor API health and usage
- Enforce schema compatibility rules

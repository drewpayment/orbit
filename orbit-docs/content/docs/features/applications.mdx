# Applications

Orbit tracks every deployed service as an **Application** — providing a unified catalog with health monitoring, dependency mapping, and full lineage back to its origin template.

## Application Catalog

The application catalog is your single source of truth for everything running in production:

- **Service Registry** — Every application with its repository, owner, and status
- **Health Monitoring** — At-a-glance health indicators across all services
- **Search & Filter** — Find applications by name, team, status, or technology

## Creating Applications

Applications can be created in two ways:

### From a Template
The recommended path. Navigate to **Templates**, pick a blueprint, and Orbit scaffolds a complete service with CI/CD, K8s manifests, and docs. The new application automatically appears in the catalog with a lineage link to its template.

### Import Existing Repository
Already have a service? Import it from GitHub and Orbit will:
- Index the repository metadata
- Detect the `.orbit.yaml` manifest (if present)
- Add it to the workspace catalog

## `.orbit.yaml` Manifest

The `.orbit.yaml` file is a declarative manifest that lives in your service repo:

```yaml
apiVersion: orbit/v1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: my-service
  description: User authentication service
  owner: platform-team
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: production
  system: auth
  dependsOn:
    - component:user-db
    - resource:redis-cache
  providesApis:
    - auth-api
  consumesApis:
    - notification-api
```

Orbit syncs this manifest bidirectionally — changes in the UI update the file, and changes in the file update Orbit.

## Lineage Tracking

For applications created from templates, Orbit maintains a lineage graph showing:

- Which template was used
- When the application was instantiated
- Drift detection between the template and the service
- Related applications from the same template

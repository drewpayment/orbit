# IDP Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST meet strict quality standards before acceptance. Code reviews MUST verify adherence to established coding standards, proper documentation, and architectural consistency. No code may be merged without passing automated quality gates including linting, formatting, and static analysis. Complex logic MUST include explanatory comments. Dead code and unused imports MUST be removed. Code duplication MUST be eliminated through proper abstraction.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-Driven Development is mandatory for all features. Tests MUST be written before implementation code. All tests MUST fail initially, then pass after implementation. Red-Green-Refactor cycle MUST be strictly enforced. Code coverage MUST be maintained at minimum 90% for business logic, 80% overall. Critical authentication and authorization flows MUST achieve 100% test coverage. Integration tests MUST cover all API endpoints and external service interactions.

### III. User Experience Consistency
User interfaces MUST provide consistent interaction patterns across all components. Authentication flows MUST be intuitive and secure. Error messages MUST be clear, actionable, and user-friendly. Response times MUST be predictable and fast. Visual design MUST follow established design system principles. Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) MUST be met. User feedback MUST be incorporated through regular usability testing.

### IV. Performance Requirements
API responses MUST complete within 200ms for 95th percentile requests under normal load. Authentication operations MUST complete within 100ms for 95th percentile. Database queries MUST be optimized and indexed appropriately. Caching strategies MUST be implemented for frequently accessed data. Memory usage MUST remain below 512MB per service instance. Horizontal scaling MUST support up to 10,000 concurrent users. Performance regression testing MUST be automated and run on every release.

## Security & Compliance Standards

Identity and authentication systems MUST implement industry-standard security practices. All authentication tokens MUST be signed and validated. Session management MUST follow OWASP guidelines. Password storage MUST use bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds. Multi-factor authentication MUST be supported for privileged accounts. Security headers MUST be implemented on all HTTP responses. Regular security audits MUST be conducted. Data protection and privacy regulations MUST be followed. Audit logging MUST be comprehensive and tamper-evident.

## Development Quality Gates

All features MUST pass through mandatory quality checkpoints. Code reviews MUST be completed by at least one senior developer. Automated testing MUST pass on all supported platforms. Security scanning MUST complete without high-severity vulnerabilities. Performance benchmarks MUST meet established thresholds. Documentation MUST be updated for all user-facing changes. Database migrations MUST be reversible and tested. Backward compatibility MUST be maintained or explicitly documented.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and policies. Amendments require documentation of rationale, impact analysis, and approval by project maintainers. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify constitutional compliance. Violations MUST be addressed before code acceptance. Complexity that violates principles MUST be justified with clear business rationale and migration plans. Regular compliance audits MUST be conducted quarterly. Constitutional principles MUST be reflected in all project templates and automation tools.
